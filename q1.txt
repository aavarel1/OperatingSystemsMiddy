For each of the following process state transition, say whether the transition is
legal and how the transition occurs or why it cannot.
    a. Change from thread state WAIT to thread state RUNNING
        answer: not legal because it requires the ready intermediate stage
    b. Change from thread state RUNNING to thread state WAIT
        answer: legal since the thread may block itself to wait for some event or resource.
    c. Change from thread state READY to thread state WAIT 
        answer: it is also legal because they are stages next to each other
